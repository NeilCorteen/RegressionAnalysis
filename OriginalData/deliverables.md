# Mid-bootcamp project deliverables

You should maintain a separate GitHub repo for this project with the following files:

- `Readme.md` - This markdown will explain the data analysis workflow including the problem statement/ business the objective, data extraction, data wrangling, etc. Here you should explain the business analytic approach you used to solve the problem. Please be detailed in explaining the steps you followed. It is important to keep in mind that the document is written for the readers, who may or may not have the technical expertise with Python/SQL/Tableau.
- Python File - It can be either uploaded as a `.ipynb` file (Jupyter notebook) or `.py` file. The Python code should be well documented with comments, explaining the code, EDA operations, logic used - especially with data cleaning operations, and any assumptions followed in the model.
- Dataset/datasets (provided to you)
- Tableau workbook
- File containing SQL queries

\*\* You are provided with the rubrics that will be used to evaluate the projects. Please go through the document for more details on the specificities for different files.

### Some other tips

- Pay attention to the naming convention: organize the files in folders with appropriate names
- Do not include code snippets in the `Readme.md` file
- Explain the business insights and the regression/classification model results
- Explain the future score of work
- Make daily commits to the repo
